This program highlights fires in an image by identifying pixels
whose red intensity is more than INTENSITY_THRESHOLD times the
average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel. Those
"sufficiently red" pixels are then highlighted in the image

green, and blue values to be all the same average value.
